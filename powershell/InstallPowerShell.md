To install PowerShell on Ubuntu Linux 18.04 LTS, you can use the [Ubuntu snap package](https://snapcraft.io/).


```powershell
snap install powershell --classic
```

**IMPORTANT**: You will need to run the above command with `sudo` if you are not root.

Once PowerShell has been installed, go ahead and launch it by typing `pwsh{ENTER}`.
